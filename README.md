# Anti-Scalper-Scalper-Bot
Being at home has increased online shopping. Many times, items become out of stock and the resale prices are ridiculous. A graphics card intially released for 
$500 is now roughly $1000.

To combat this, and to teach others, I have built this bot for both Best Buy and Newegg. Other online shopping websites will be added later.

Many of these scalper bots are written using Python and Selenium, but other languages such as Java and JavaScript have Selenium as well.

Because of the nature of websites, some of the XPATH values change, replacing it with a new one is sufficient.
